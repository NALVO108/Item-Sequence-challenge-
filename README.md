# Item-Sequence-challenge-
This is a silly python game that I made When I was getting bored. In This, When you will run the game you will be provided with the rules of the game, How the game works and How to win it... In this game, a random sequence of items is generated each time you start. To Win the game, you must pick every item in the correct order without selecting any item twice. Use the commands "pick (item name)" to choose an item and "drop (item name)" to release it. The game offers three difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, and Hard - providing options for players of all skill levels. Have a fun time playing it, and some suggestions will be really appriciated :)
